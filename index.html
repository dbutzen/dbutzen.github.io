    <h3>Dan's Story</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Dan started his adult life at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where he achieved a Bachelor's of Science from the Physics Department. Post-graduation, he decided to explore 
        a possible future in the actuarial field, and proceeded to pass the first three exams (probability, financial mathematics, and methods of financial economics) before deciding
        against this possible future. Remembering some computer science classes he took at Madison, Dan looked into the computer science field, and found his calling. Now a student
        at the Fox Valley Technical College, Dan is continuing to pursue programming with a passion, going above and beyond on assignments, and pushing passed the scope of the classes
        he takes.</p>

        <p>Currently working full time in a lead position at a local supermarket, Dan continues to attend college full time and find spare time for projects outside of school, including 
        programming an isometric city builder in Unity, creating a MySql database to track his life habits (including front end interface), and maintaining and improving this website.</p>

        <p>Dan hopes to find a full time internship in the web or software development fields to further his goals of becoming a successful programmer.

    <h3>Dear Hiring Manager,</h3>
    <p>I am writing to express interest in an internship position in web development or software development. My analytical skills, ability to learn quickly, 
        and communication aptitude all make me an ideal fit for a position in either of these categories.</p>
    <p>My analytical skills and potential make me an ideal candidate for any position. My degree in physics, while not my calling in life, 
        does show my ability to learn complex concepts in math and logic. I also was successful in passing the Mensa exam, further showing how high my ceiling can go. 
        Given my potential, I am excited to continue my work in programming and web development.</p>
    <p>My quick learning has always helped me succeed in what I do, whether that be in employment or academia. After graduating college the first time, 
        I briefly decided to pursue a possible future in the actuarial field, and made it through three exams (probability, financial mathematics, 
        and methods of financial economics) before deciding against it. My ability to learn quickly allowed me to study on my own and pass these difficult exams. 
        On the employment side, I was put into a leadership role in a new environment at my current job (festival foods) when I switched from produce clerk to popcorn stall lead. 
        I was able to learn the job through two days of training, and was trusted to take over completely immediately after. 
        My ability to learn speedily is an attribute which will allow me to succeed no matter the case.</p>
    <p>Accurate and understandable communication is a necessity at any job site. My current employment requires communication at multiple levels. 
        Speaking with customers requires one language, management another, written communication to corporate a third, and maintenance a fourth. 
        The ability to cycle through these communication types depending on the situation takes time to learn, and after years of experience, 
        I find myself to be more than capable of tackling whatever communication level is thrown at me.</p>
    <p>It took me longer than I expected to find what I enjoy doing for employment, but now that I know where I want to be, 
        I’m ready to put myself fully into showing what I’m capable of and moving forward quickly in the workplace.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to discussing my possible future at your company,</p>
    <br />
    <p>Daniel Butzen</p>
